# CI-CD_with_Jenkins_Ansible_Kubernetes
Master DevOps CI/CD pipelines using Git, Jenkins, Maven

Agenda:
I will start with building and deploying it on the Tomcat server. I will set up CI/CD with GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, and Tomcat. Initially, there is no environment; therefore, I start with setting up Jenkins, configuring Maven and Git, Tomcat server, integrating GitHub, Maven, Tomcat server with Jenkins, creating a CI and CD job, and testing the deployment.

By the end, I will be able to confidently set up and complete CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy a Java application on AWS.
See you soon:)
